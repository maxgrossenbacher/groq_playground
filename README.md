## Overview

This project provides tools to interact with Groq's LLM API, specifically focused on web content summarization. It uses Groq's high-performance inference platform to process and summarize web content quickly and efficiently.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Groq API key (Get your free API key from [Groq Developer Console](https://console.groq.com))
- Google Search API key (For topic researcher)
- pip (Python package manager)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/groq_playground.git
cd groq_playground
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Set up your environment variables in `.env`:
```text
GROQ_API_KEY=your-groq-api-key-here
GOOGLE_SEARCH_API_KEY=your-google-api-key-here
GOOGLE_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID=your-search-engine-id-here
```

## Modules

### Web Page Summarizer

The webpage summarizer module (`webpage_summarizer.py`) provides functionality to summarize content from any web page using Groq's AI models.

#### Basic Usage

1. **As a Python Module**:
```python
from webpage_summarizer import GroqSummarizer

# Initialize summarizer
summarizer = GroqSummarizer(
    model="deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b",
    max_length=500,
    temperature=0.7
)

# Summarize a webpage
url = "https://groq.com"
summary = summarizer.summarize_webpage(url)
print(summary)
```

2. **From Command Line**:
```bash
# Basic usage
python webpage_summarizer.py --url https://groq.com

# Interactive mode
python webpage_summarizer.py
```

#### Command Line Options

```bash
python webpage_summarizer.py [options]

Options:
  --url URL             URL to summarize
  --max-length LENGTH   Maximum length of summary (default: 500)
  --temperature TEMP    Temperature for text generation (default: 0.7)
  --model MODEL         Groq model to use (default: deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b)
```

#### Example Output

Here's an example of summarizing Groq's website:

# Groq Web Content Summarizer

#### üìù Summary

*Model's Thought Process:*

First, I'll scan through the text. I see mentions of GroqCloud‚Ñ¢, a self-serve developer tier, which suggests they're expanding access to their platform. There are also specific models like PlayAI Dialog and Mistral Saba 24B, which are probably new releases. Then, there's information about funding rounds and valuations, indicating financial growth.

I should make sure each main point captures these elements. The first point could be about the launch of new models and services. The second point should cover their cloud platform's accessibility and compatibility. The third point would highlight their financial achievements and industry recognition.

I need to ensure the summary is clear and each point is distinct. Also, the user emphasized conciseness, so I'll keep each point brief without losing important details.

*Final Summary:*

1. **Groq Launches New AI Models and Services:** Groq has introduced several new AI models and services, including PlayAI Dialog for more human-like voice AI, Mistral Saba 24B for the Middle East and South Asia, and Qwen QwQ-32B available on GroqCloud‚Ñ¢. Additionally, GroqCloud‚Ñ¢ now offers a self-serve developer tier.

2. **GroqCloud‚Ñ¢ Platform and Compatibility:** GroqCloud‚Ñ¢ provides fast AI inference for popular models like Llama, Mixtral, and Whisper. It offers seamless migration from other providers, such as OpenAI, with minimal code changes, and has been benchmarked for speed and efficiency.

3. **Groq's Growth and Recognition:** Groq has raised significant funding, achieving a valuation of $2.8 billion, and is recognized as a major challenger to Nvidia in the AI chip market. Its technology has been praised by industry leaders like Yann LeCun, and the company continues to expand its offerings and user base.

### Topic Researcher

The Topic Researcher module uses Google Custom Search to find relevant sources about a topic and generates comprehensive summaries using the Groq API.

#### Setup

1. Get a Google Custom Search API key:
   - Visit [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com)
   - Create a new project or select existing
   - Enable Custom Search API
   - Create credentials (API key)

2. Set up a Custom Search Engine:
   - Visit [Programmable Search Engine](https://programmablesearchengine.google.com)
   - Create a new search engine
   - Get your Search Engine ID
   - Configure for searching the entire web

3. Configure environment variables as shown in the Installation section

#### Basic Usage

Run the topic researcher:
```bash
python topic_researcher.py
```

When prompted, enter your research topic:
