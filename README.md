# Groq Playground

A playground project for experimenting with the Groq API, demonstrating web content summarization capabilities.

## Overview

This project provides tools to interact with Groq's LLM API, specifically focused on web content summarization. It uses Groq's high-performance inference platform to process and summarize web content quickly and efficiently.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Groq API key (Get your free API key from [Groq Developer Console](https://console.groq.com))
- pip (Python package manager)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/groq_playground.git
cd groq_playground
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Set up your Groq API key:
```bash
export GROQ_API_KEY='your-api-key-here'
```

## Usage Example

Here's an example of how to use the module to summarize the Groq website (https://groq.com):

```python
from groq_summarizer import summarize_webpage

# Example usage
url = "https://groq.com"
summary = summarize_webpage(url)
print(summary)
```

Expected output will include key information about Groq, such as:
- Their AI inference platform capabilities
- Available models (Llama, Mixtral, Gemma, Whisper)
- Recent company valuation ($2.8B)
- Developer access through GroqCloudâ„¢

## Features

- Web content extraction
- AI-powered summarization using Groq's LLM
- Support for various webpage formats
- Configurable summarization parameters

## Configuration

You can customize the summarization behavior by modifying these parameters:

```python
summarize_webpage(
    url,
    max_length=500,  # Maximum summary length
    temperature=0.7,  # Response creativity (0.0-1.0)
    model="deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b"  # Choose your preferred Groq model
)
```

## Models Available

Groq supports several open-source models:
- Llama
- DeepSeek
- Gemma
- Whisper
- And more...

## Error Handling

The module includes error handling for common issues:
- Invalid URLs
- API authentication errors
- Rate limiting
- Network connectivity issues

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any errors:

1. Check your API key is properly set:
```bash
echo $GROQ_API_KEY
```

2. Verify the URL is accessible:
```bash
curl -I https://groq.com
```

3. Ensure you have all required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Command Line Usage

### Basic Usage

1. Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd groq_playground
```

2. Run the summarizer script:
```bash
python summarize.py
```

3. When prompted, paste your URL:
```
Enter the URL to summarize: https://groq.com
```

4. The script will then:
   - Fetch the webpage content
   - Process it through Groq's API
   - Display the summary in your terminal

### Command Line Arguments

You can also run the script directly with a URL:
```bash
python summarize.py --url https://groq.com
```

Additional options:
```bash
python summarize.py --url https://groq.com --max-length 500 --temperature 0.7
```

Available arguments:
- `--url`: The webpage URL to summarize
- `--max-length`: Maximum length of the summary (default: 500)
- `--temperature`: Controls creativity of the response (default: 0.7)
- `--model`: Specify the Groq model to use (default: mixtral-8x7b-32768)
