# Groq Playground

A playground project for experimenting with the Groq API, demonstrating web content summarization capabilities.

## Overview

This project provides tools to interact with Groq's LLM API, specifically focused on web content summarization. It uses Groq's high-performance inference platform to process and summarize web content quickly and efficiently.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Groq API key (Get your free API key from [Groq Developer Console](https://console.groq.com))
- pip (Python package manager)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/groq_playground.git
cd groq_playground
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Set up your Groq API key:
```bash
export GROQ_API_KEY='your-api-key-here'
```

## Usage Example

Here's an example of how to use the module to summarize the Groq website (https://groq.com):

```python
from groq_summarizer import summarize_webpage

# Example usage
url = "https://groq.com"
summary = summarize_webpage(url)
print(summary)
```

Expected output will include key information about Groq, such as:
- Their AI inference platform capabilities
- Available models (Llama, Mixtral, Gemma, Whisper)
- Recent company valuation ($2.8B)
- Developer access through GroqCloud™

## Features

- Web content extraction
- AI-powered summarization using Groq's LLM
- Support for various webpage formats
- Configurable summarization parameters

## Configuration

You can customize the summarization behavior by modifying these parameters:

```python
summarize_webpage(
    url,
    max_length=500,  # Maximum summary length
    temperature=0.7,  # Response creativity (0.0-1.0)
    model="deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b"  # Choose your preferred Groq model
)
```

## Models Available

Groq supports several open-source models:
- Llama
- DeepSeek
- Gemma
- Whisper
- And more...

## Error Handling

The module includes error handling for common issues:
- Invalid URLs
- API authentication errors
- Rate limiting
- Network connectivity issues

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any errors:

1. Check your API key is properly set:
```bash
echo $GROQ_API_KEY
```

2. Verify the URL is accessible:
```bash
curl -I https://groq.com
```

3. Ensure you have all required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Command Line Usage

### Basic Usage

1. Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd groq_playground/website_summarizer
```

2. Run the summarizer script:
```bash
python groq_summarizer.py
```

3. When prompted, paste your URL:
```
Enter the URL to summarize: https://groq.com
```

4. The script will then:
   - Fetch the webpage content
   - Process it through Groq's API
   - Display the summary in your terminal

### Command Line Arguments

You can also run the script directly with a URL:
```bash
python groq_summarizer.py --url https://groq.com
```

Additional options:
```bash
python groq_summarizer.py --url https://groq.com --max-length 500 --temperature 0.7
```

Available arguments:
- `--url`: The webpage URL to summarize
- `--max-length`: Maximum length of the summary (default: 500)
- `--temperature`: Controls creativity of the response (default: 0.7)
- `--model`: Specify the Groq model to use (default: mixtral-8x7b-32768)

### Example Output

When you run the summarizer, you'll see output formatted like this:

│  First, I need to read through the text carefully. It looks like the text is from a website or a             │
│  promotional material for Groq, highlighting their products, services, and recent news. The user wants the   │
│  main points extracted without the fluff.                                                                    │

│  I notice that Groq is focused on AI inference, specifically with their GroqCloud platform. They have a      │
│  self-serve developer tier available now, which is a key point. There's mention of a new TTS model called    │
│  PlayAI Dialog, which makes voice AI sound more human. That seems important.                                 │
│                                                                                                              │
│  Looking further, there are specific models like Mistral Saba 24B for the Middle East and South Asia, and    │
│  Qwen QwQ-32B running on their cloud. These are specialized models, so they should be included.              │
│                                                                                                              │
│  The text also talks about how easy it is to switch from OpenAI by changing just three lines of code.        │
│  That's a big selling point for developers, so that's definitely worth noting.                               │
│                                                                                                              │
│  Financial aspects are mentioned too, with Groq raising $640 million and being valued at $2.8 billion. This  │
│  indicates their growth and position in the market, competing with major players like Nvidia.                │
│                                                                                                              │
│  There are endorsements from Yann LeCun, which adds credibility. Also, the availability of benchmarks and    │
│  the emphasis on speed from independent analyses should be highlighted.                                      │
│                                                                                                              │
│  I should structure the summary to include all these points in a logical flow: start with what Groq is       │
│  known for, their new products and services, ease of integration, financial status, endorsements, and        │
│  performance benchmarks.                                                                                     │

│  I need to make sure the summary is concise, so I'll avoid redundant information and focus on the most       │
│  impactful details. The user probably needs this for a quick overview or to share key updates, so clarity    │
│  is essential.                                                                                               │

│                                                                                                              │
│  Groq specializes in fast AI inference, offering solutions like GroqCloud™, a platform for running openly    │
│  available models such as Llama, Whisper, and Qwen. The company recently launched PlayAI Dialog, a           │
│  text-to-speech (TTS) model designed to produce more human-like voice AI. GroqCloud™ now has a self-serve    │
│  developer tier, making it easier for developers to access and integrate AI models. The platform is          │
│  compatible with OpenAI, requiring only minimal code changes to migrate. Groq has raised significant         │
│  funding, with a valuation of $2.8 billion, and is recognized for its high-speed inference capabilities, as  │
│  validated by independent benchmarks. The company also offers specialized models like Mistral Saba 24B for   │
│  the Middle East and South Asia. Groq is endorsed by AI leaders like Yann LeCun and is positioned as a key   │
│  challenger to Nvidia in the AI chip market.                                                                 │
